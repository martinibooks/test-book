# FicShelf - The Platform 

## Marketplace

A Marketplace where independent professionals of the publishing eco-system (writers, designers, editors, proof-readers etc.) can collaborate and make money.

**The way it works:** 

  * Writers create profiles through which they are able to connect with professionals. 

  * Publishing professionals create profiles on the FicShelf platform through which they can create portfolios, visual representations of their skills, and show work experience;

  * Through the Book Project Manager, writers can create sub-projects (cover design project, editing project etc.), hire professionals for each sub-project, and easily oversee these projects.
  
  * We have started with book as the only type of project but soon enough we will have graphic novels, coffee table books and cook books added as options. The hard work is done so it won't take much to adapt the code.

  * FicShelf charges a **commission** on the fees paid for services. 

In addition, FicShelf provides considerable guidance on the self-publishing process. Authors always know what steps they should be taking and what results they should expect.

**Fundraising:** FicShelf provides donation-based crowdfunding functionality. It helps writers with the money issuem, at the same time raise awareness of their books before they are complete, thus also solving the issue of visibility. 
FicShelf does not take commission on funds raised, but all funds must be spent through the platform.

**Rating System:** Guarantees natural selection of the best professionals and also encourages professionals to keep the projects within the platform. Higher ratings increase their visibility and the possibility of more work.


**Revenue Sharing:** as an alternative to fixed-fee payments, we also allow customised revenue share as a payment option.

## Social Publishing

The second aspect of the solution is a **creative platform** where writers can develop their ideas into books and engage readers in the creative process, subsequently gathering a following:


* **Writing Tool** - Helps writers to plan the book's universe: outlines, characters' profiles, chapters' outlines and develop it all into compelling stories;

* **Editing Tool** - Helps writers better organise projects in the FicShelf Market Place, the book manuscript is kept in the cloud so several professionals can comment and collaborate simultaneously. The control remains with the writer, though.

* **Formatting & Publishing Tool** - Writers can convert files into eBook formats and publish to their chosen eBook shops. 

* **Periodical Publishing Tool** - Writers can publish books as periodicals, which helps to conduct market research and improve their style. Writers can charge per chapter and obtain revenue before even finishing a book. This all encourages interaction with readers and fans.   

* **Book Cover Tool** - Users create covers in three simple steps. FicShelf is also in negotiation with DeviantArt, an online artist community with over 20 million users, to share their API with us. This would make their artwork database available through Ficshelf. 

* **Distribution Tool** - writers convert their manuscripts into an eBook and send them to different online eBook retailers with one click. A special dashboard helps manage the process.

#### Revenue generation:
* The Creative Platform will increase subscription rates and user retention.

* Once tools are fully developed, a pro version with charged subscription will be created. 

* At the heart of Social Publishing are periodocals. We will books as Periodicals. Dickens' style. 

* Distribution tool will have a separate revenue flow â€“ share of commission on eBook sales through other online shops.      



## Social eCommerce Platform

The most important aspect of our solution is the Fichelf Social eCommerce Platform.

We provide a distribution channel for eBooks but most importantly, we are **innovating the way ebooks are being sold to readers**. 

Readers are going to **buy books directly from their favourite authors' social networking profiles**. We will make **eBook sales more intimate and ethical**. Readers will be aware that their writers are getting the best deal in the market. People care how their money is being spent. It is called **ethical buying**.


* Ficshelf will charge 10% from every sale. Why? Because we want to be competitive and grow in such a way that independent writers and publishing houses won't be able to afford to ignore Fichelf eCommerce Platform.

FicShelf will also develop several apps:

* for readers;

* for authors;

* for editors.
