# What Writers Say...



## Kahlen Aymes, Self-published Author (USA)

Self-published writer. Over 150,000 ebooks sold on Amazon

>For me, I just want to write and let someone else do the technical stuff like formatting and uploading to the sales venues. I do a LOT of social media, and promotion is as much work as writing. There are some writers who do their own formatting, etc. I'm not one of them.



## Amy Noelle, Indie writer (USA)

10 Million downloads at fanfiction.net. Recently signed with indie publisher Writer's

Coffee Shop, original publisher of the 50 Shades Trilogy

>I definitely think my book could use more marketing but I don't have the time or the self-promotion skills to do so. Having direct links to sales is always a good idea. Having a built in readership like I did at FF and like your site proposes definitely helps as well. Loyal readers tend to follow you through your creative endeavors. Sounds like a good plan and I wish you luck.

## Lissa Bryan, Published Indie Writer (USA)

Former fanfiction writer with over 1.9 Million downloads.

>I think it's a great idea, actually. I certainly had a lot of people interested in it. I suggest adding publicity services. That's one aspect that's a huge burden on indie authors. I spend a LOT of time doing my social media, promotional posts, etc. That's one of the first services I would engage, if I had the money to do it. Someone who would take care of Facebook/Twitter/Goodreads/contests, etc.



## Christy Birmingham, Independent Writer (USA)

>What a great platform you are developing! I think it will absolutely help writers. I am thinking of self-publishing in the future (fiction and poetry) and it is the costs that are a little overwhelming. To offer free editing services as part of your program would be an incredible benefit for any author.

>I also feel overwhelmed by the idea of how to format the book, so that it presents correctly as an e-book product. There are so many resources available online that it's a little overwhelming at times. I like that your program would have everything available in one place. It is is still online but there is one place to go to find all the stuff a writer would need in order to publish.



## Michelle Browne, independent writer & editor (USA)

>The ebook market is a very exciting place. I'm a self-published author as well, and often work with other indie writers. My first two books had self-designed covers and were beta-read by others. My most recent works have had properly-designed, professional covers, professional formatting, and were edited much more extensively. That has made a difference in the quality of the books.
> This leads me to FicShelf -- I think it's a really cool idea and that you might just have a winner. I've heard of a few totally independent publishing companies trying to shake off the burden of Amazon and Smashwords; I'd be interested in taking part in that. It sounds like a sort of hybrid Createspace, Wattpad, and Amazon community, which is very intriguing. Please, sign me up!



## Curtis Cansino, Independent Writer (USA)

> FicShelf sounds really cool. The idea of building a website to help a writer, or an aspiring writer to hit the ground running, is quite unique.

Deborah Greaves, Independently Published Author (Canada)

>In my limited experience, there are many challenges to self publishing, and one in particular is not a 'hurdle' â€“ it is a mountain. That mountain is the requirement for cash, much of it 'up front.'

>One needs the work to be edited, the book to be designed, the book to be assigned its ISBN number, then it needs to be printed, assembled, pages cut, book reassembled, book bound, and delivered.

>Another mountain to climb is Marketing the book once it has been produced. When one is self publishing, everything and anything is Do It Yourself. And 'PAY for it yourself' goes with that.

>The marketing mountain is huge, and then, we have Distribution to consider.

>I went to a seminar on Self Publishing, and the first thing the speaker said was, ' We need to change the mindset around this kind of publishing. Think of it as Independent Publishing.'

>I liked that approach. However, I suspect few writers would independently publish if they could avoid it, even those who are wealthy. The planning, design, marketing and distribution of hardcopy books is labour, cash and time intensive. When does one write ?

>I've become interested in on-line publishing because it seems that promotion and distribution are so fast, easy and inexpensive. The readers decide quickly if they like your book or not.

>If there isn't much reaction, at least the writer hasn't sunk his or her life savings into the creation and distribution of that book.

>However, I was born in 1953 and have no idea how to get the on-line ball rolling once my books are ready.
