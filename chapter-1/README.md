# The Revolution

*Ficshelf is the social eCommerce platform taking power from publishers and giving it to writers, editors and readers.*

```We are disrupting the traditional publishing industry that is in terminal decline and leading the revolution for all those who love literature.```

__We are the Etsy to Ebay, the AirBnB to hotels, the Uber to the Black Cab.__
