# The Revolution

*Use your time wisely. __Write.__*

FicShelf is disrupting the traditional publishing industry that is in terminal decline and leading the revolution for all those who love literature.

We start by creating a Market Place so independent professionals such as writers, designers, editors, proofreaders and the whole publishing eco-system can collaborate and make money.

The second aspect of the solution is a creative platform where writers can develop their ideas into books and engage readers in the creative process, subsequently gathering a following. This is a well known phenomenon called [Social Publishing](http://blog.ficshelf.com/3704798).

Finally, FicShelf will also provide a distribution channel for eBooks but most importantly, we are innovating the way ebooks are being sold to readers. Readers are going to buy the books directly from their favourite authors' social networking profiles. We will make eBook sales more intimate and ethical. Readers will be aware that their writers are getting the best deal in the market.

We are bringing together all the different aspects of online publishing.

We have come up with collaborative tools that help publishing professionals to work. We aim to continually add to the platform. 

We recognise that it is not just about cutting edge technology. Professional ebooks need investment, upfront payments, which most writers unfortunately can't afford. FicShelf caters for that by providing crowdfunding-like functionality and alternative payment plans for publishing services, such as profit sharing.
